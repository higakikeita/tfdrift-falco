# Twitter/X Thread: TFDrift-Falco v0.2.0-beta Release

---

## 🧵 Thread 1: Feature Announcement (Recommended)

**Tweet 1/10** (Hook)
🎉 Just released TFDrift-Falco v0.2.0-beta!

Real-time Terraform drift detection that alerts you in <30 seconds when someone makes manual changes to your AWS infrastructure.

95 CloudTrail events | 12 services | Production-ready

Open source & MIT licensed 🚀

🧵👇

---

**Tweet 2/10** (The Problem)
The problem every DevOps team faces:

❌ Someone makes a "quick fix" in AWS Console
❌ Hours later, terraform apply fails mysteriously
❌ No idea who changed what
❌ Debugging takes forever

Sound familiar? There's a better way...

---

**Tweet 3/10** (The Solution)
TFDrift-Falco monitors your infrastructure in REAL-TIME:

✅ Detects changes within 30 seconds
✅ Shows WHO made the change
✅ Alerts via Slack/Discord/webhooks
✅ Compares against Terraform state

No more surprises during deployments!

---

**Tweet 4/10** (How It Works)
The magic happens in 3 steps:

1️⃣ Falco CloudTrail plugin captures AWS API calls
2️⃣ TFDrift compares with Terraform state
3️⃣ Instant alert with full context

Event-driven architecture = zero polling overhead

**Tweet 5/10** (Coverage Stats)
v0.2.0-beta Coverage:

📊 95 CloudTrail events (+265%)
🎯 12 AWS services
⚡ <30s detection latency
🐳 Official Docker image
📈 80%+ test coverage

Services: VPC, IAM, ELB, KMS, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, EC2, RDS, CloudFront, SNS, SQS, ECR

---

**Tweet 6/10** (Real-World Example)
Here's what an alert looks like:

```
🚨 Critical Drift Detected
Resource: aws_s3_bucket.production-data
Changed: encryption = DISABLED
User: john.doe@company.com
Source: AWS Console
Time: 10:30:45 UTC
```

You see this 30 seconds after the change, not hours later.

---

**Tweet 7/10** (Grafana Dashboards)
Comes with 3 production-ready Grafana dashboards:

📊 Overview: Total drifts, severity breakdown, timeline
🔍 Diff Details: Before/after comparison
🎨 Heatmap: Drift patterns & trends

Get started in 5 minutes:
```
cd dashboards/grafana
./quick-start.sh
```

## 🧵 Thread 2: Problem-Solution Format (Alternative)

**Tweet 1/8** (Hook with Problem)
Ever had terraform apply fail because someone "just quickly" changed something in the AWS Console?

Yeah, me too.

So I built TFDrift-Falco to solve it.

v0.2.0-beta just dropped 🚀

Thread on what it does and why it matters 👇

---

**Tweet 2/8** (Pain Point)
The cycle of pain:

1. Infrastructure is in Terraform
2. Someone makes manual change in Console
3. Nobody tells anyone
4. Days later: terraform apply fails
5. Spend hours debugging
6. Discover the manual change
7. Update Terraform
8. Repeat next week

This happens to EVERY team.

---

**Tweet 3/8** (The Insight)
The insight:

CloudTrail already logs EVERY AWS API call.
Falco can monitor CloudTrail in real-time.
Terraform state shows expected configuration.

What if we combined all three?

→ Real-time drift detection with <30s latency

---

**Tweet 4/8** (The Solution)
TFDrift-Falco does exactly that:

🔍 Monitors 95 CloudTrail events
⚡ Detects drift in <30 seconds
👤 Shows who made the change
🎯 Alerts via Slack/Discord
📊 Beautiful Grafana dashboards

Open source. MIT licensed. Production-ready.

---

**Tweet 5/8** (Technical Details)
Technical highlights:

• Event-driven architecture (no polling!)
• Supports 12 AWS services
• 80%+ test coverage
• Docker & Kubernetes native
• Horizontal scaling support
• Prometheus/Grafana integration

Built for production from day 1.

---

**Tweet 6/8** (Quick Demo)
Quick demo:

```bash
# Install
docker pull ghcr.io/higakikeita/tfdrift-falco:latest

# Run
docker run -e TF_STATE_BACKEND=s3 \
  ghcr.io/higakikeita/tfdrift-falco:latest

# Make AWS Console change
# Get Slack alert in 30 seconds ✨
```

That's literally it.

---

**Tweet 7/8** (Results)
Early results from beta testers:

"Caught unauthorized security group change within 30 seconds"

"Prevented S3 encryption disable before it became an incident"

"Finally have visibility into who's making Console changes"

This is the feedback that keeps me going.

## 🧵 Thread 3: Story Format (Viral Potential)

**Tweet 1/7** (Personal Hook)
A year ago, our production S3 bucket encryption got disabled.

We discovered it 3 days later during a terraform apply.

3 days of exposure.
No idea who did it.
Hours of incident investigation.

That shouldn't happen. So I fixed it.

Thread 👇

---

**Tweet 2/7** (The Realization)
I realized:

We have CloudTrail logging everything.
We have Terraform state showing expected config.
We have Falco for real-time monitoring.

But nobody connected them.

What if we did?

---

**Tweet 3/7** (The Build)
So I built TFDrift-Falco.

It monitors AWS in real-time and alerts when infrastructure drifts from Terraform state.

Detection time: <30 seconds
Alert includes: WHO, WHAT, WHEN
Coverage: 95 CloudTrail events across 12 services

v0.2.0-beta just released.

---

**Tweet 4/7** (The Impact)
Now when someone disables S3 encryption:

❌ Before: Discover 3 days later
✅ After: Alert in 30 seconds

❌ Before: Unknown who did it
✅ After: Full user attribution

❌ Before: Hours of debugging
✅ After: Fix immediately

Game changer.

---

**Tweet 5/7** (The Tech)
Under the hood:

• Falco CloudTrail plugin captures events
• TFDrift compares with Terraform state
• Instant alerts via Slack/Discord
• Grafana dashboards for visualization

Event-driven, no polling.
Docker-ready.
80%+ test coverage.

---

**Tweet 6/7** (The Numbers)
v0.2.0-beta stats:
