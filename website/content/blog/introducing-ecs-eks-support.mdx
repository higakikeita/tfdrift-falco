# Introducing ECS and EKS Support in TFDrift-Falco

We're thrilled to announce that **TFDrift-Falco v0.3.0-dev** now includes comprehensive support for **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** and **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**!

## What's New

### Amazon ECS Support (13 CloudTrail Events)

Monitor critical container orchestration events:

- **Services**: CreateService, UpdateService, DeleteService
- **Task Definitions**: RegisterTaskDefinition, DeregisterTaskDefinition
- **Clusters**: CreateCluster, DeleteCluster, UpdateClusterSettings
- **Capacity Providers**: PutClusterCapacityProviders
- **Tasks**: RunTask, StartTask, StopTask

### Amazon EKS Support (12 CloudTrail Events)

Track Kubernetes cluster changes in real-time:

- **Clusters**: CreateCluster, DeleteCluster, UpdateClusterConfig
- **Node Groups**: CreateNodegroup, DeleteNodegroup, UpdateNodegroupConfig
- **Addons**: CreateAddon, DeleteAddon, UpdateAddon
- **Fargate Profiles**: DeleteFargateProfile

## Why This Matters

Container orchestration is critical for modern cloud infrastructure. With this release, you can now:

1. **Detect unauthorized changes** to your container clusters instantly
2. **Track who made what changes** with full IAM context
3. **Ensure compliance** by monitoring all ECS/EKS modifications
4. **Prevent configuration drift** in your containerized workloads

## Example Use Case

```yaml
# Detect when someone modifies your production ECS service
drift_rules:
  - name: "Production ECS Service Modified"
    resource_types:
      - "aws_ecs_service"
    watched_attributes:
      - "desired_count"
      - "task_definition"
    severity: "critical"
    
notifications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    channel: "#prod-alerts"
```

When someone changes the desired count or updates the task definition via AWS Console, you'll get an instant Slack alert with:

- Who made the change (IAM user/role)
- What was changed (before/after values)
- When it happened (CloudTrail timestamp)
- Suggested remediation actions

## Test Coverage

We take quality seriously:

- **ECS**: 85.2% test coverage
- **EKS**: Comprehensive unit tests
- All critical paths covered

## What's Next

We're continuing to expand AWS service coverage. Next on the roadmap:

- Lambda Enhanced (10 events)
- EC2 Enhanced (15 events)
- ElastiCache (12 events)
- Auto Scaling (10 events)

**Target for v0.3.0**: 198 CloudTrail events (currently at 120 - 61% complete)

## Get Started

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/higakikeita/tfdrift-falco:latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git pull origin main
go build -o tfdrift ./cmd/tfdrift
```
